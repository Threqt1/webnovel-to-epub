# webnovel-to-epub

A small CLI application utilizing puppeteer to scrape webnovels into epubs

Mostly made so I can fuel my webnovel addiction on mobile without needing internet

Looking to create more parsers and expand features (such as combining multiple parts of a novel from different websites)
